# Enamel-Erosion-Stage-Prediction-With-CNN
The objective of this project is to develop a web app where the user can upload an image of his/her teeth and get the details about the extent to which the enamel of his teeth is eroded. The prediction of the stage of enamel erosion is being made by doing Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks.
